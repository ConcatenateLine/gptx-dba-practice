## üìç Scenario
This simulates a production recovery where the users table is accidentally dropped and must be restored from a recent backup.

## üéØ Objective
Validate that the backup and restore workflow works as expected.

## üß† Hypothesis
The backup and restore workflow will work as expected.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Execution
Run the backup script, drop the users table, and restore from backup.

```bash
./backup.sh
```

```sql
DROP TABLE users;
```

```bash
./restore.sh
```

## üìä Result
The backup and restore workflow worked as expected.

## üîç Analysis

The sequence involved dropping the users table, which simulates an accidental deletion. After restoring from backup, the table was successfully recovered, and the row count was validated to be the same as before the drop. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the backup and restore workflow in recovering from data loss due to accidental deletion.
