## üìç Scenario
Redis keys with short TTLs are simulated to test automated cleanup. A host-based cron job runs a Bash script that scans for keys nearing expiration and deletes them proactively.

## üéØ Objective
Validate a scheduled cleanup mechanism using cron and redis-cli to remove keys with TTL under a threshold. Confirm automation via log inspection and TTL decay simulation.

## üß† Hypothesis
Keys with TTL under 60 seconds should be detected and deleted by the script. Cron should execute reliably every 5 minutes, and logs should reflect cleanup activity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Execution
1. Write a Bash script to delete expired keys
[`Cleanup script` ](../../../scripts/cleanup.sh)

2. Schedule with `cron` or simulate manually
Manual run:
```bash
docker exec -it gptx_redis bash -c "./scripts/cleanup.sh"
```

Cron job(Every 5 minutes):
```bash
# Add this line to crontab
*/5 * * * * docker exec gptx_redis bash /cleanup.sh
```

## üìä Result
- Cron executed successfully every 5 minutes.
- Log entries confirmed deletion of keys with TTL under threshold:

```bash
Sat Oct  4 05:47:57 UTC 2025: Deleting cache:test with TTL 26
Sat Oct  4 05:48:10 UTC 2025: Deleting cache:testa with TTL 22
Sat Oct  4 05:57:13 UTC 2025: Deleting cache:test with TTL 33
Sat Oct  4 05:57:27 UTC 2025: Deleting cache:testa with TTL 14
```

- TTL decay and deletion timing aligned with expectations.
- No errors or permission issues in cron or script execution.

## üîç Analysis
- Host-based cron is reliable and avoids container complexity.
- TTL-based filtering ensures only near-expired keys are targeted.
- --scan avoids blocking and scales well for large keyspaces.
- Log output provides traceability and audit trail for cleanup actions.
- Redis handles TTL expiration natively, but this script adds proactive control.

## üõ†Ô∏è Remediation or Follow-up
```bash
## Copy script to Redis container
‚ùØ docker cp ./scripts/cleanup.sh gptx_redis:/cleanup.sh

Successfully copied 2.05kB to gptx_redis:/cleanup.sh

## Set a key with TTL
‚ùØ docker exec gptx_redis redis-cli SET cache:test "temp" EX 50

OK

## Run script
‚ùØ docker exec gptx_redis bash /cleanup.sh

Deleting cache:test with TTL 30
1 

## Cron job(Every 1 minute for test)
## On host based
```bash
‚ùØ crontab -e
no crontab for ubuntuuser - using an empty one
